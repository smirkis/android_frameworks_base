### 02/08/2012:
* Synced with CyanogenMod source.
* Added README.md and HISTORY.md
* Changed packages/SystemUI/src.../statusbar/powerwidget/PowerWidget.java : redefined default values to better suit the Kindle Fire.
* Corrected error created by git, I believe this had/has something to do with a conflict when pulling in the CM changes as they had since fixed the lockscreen error that I had in my source (I hate git).
**Previous changes not listed at the time**
* Added .gitignore
* Fixed lockscreen being disabled causing statusbar FCs **Since fixed in CM source**.

* Enabled full 180 degree rotation: I would like to make this only enabled if cm_default_is_tablet is set to true but for the life of me I can't figure out how to reference the resource file for that.
